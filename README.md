# Leaf Disease Detection

Leaf disease detection is a crucial web app in agriculture, focusing on the automated identification and diagnosis of diseases and stress conditions affecting plant leaves. By analyzing images of leaves for patterns and symptoms of diseases or nutrient deficiencies, this technology-enabled web application enables early detection, precise treatment, and the promotion of sustainable farming practices. It empowers farmers with valuable insights into plant health, contributing to improved crop yields, reduced environmental impact, and enhanced food security.
## Dataset

This dataset contains 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves categorized into 38 classes. It follows an 80/20 training-validation split, preserving the directory structure, and includes 33 test images for predictions. It's a vital resource for agricultural research and machine learning applications in crop health monitoring and disease detection.
